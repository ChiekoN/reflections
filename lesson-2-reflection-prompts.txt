What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

.git directory is made.
This directory is necesarry to manage the history of changing files.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

Files in staging area are tracked by git, while files in the working directory are not.
I can check beforehand that the files I'm working on are really the ones which are supposed to be committed.


How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?

In the case there are several files changed, I first add files related to a logical change, then after checking 'git diff --staged', commit them. After that, I will add and commit another files that are related to another logical change.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?

When I want to make a different version of apps, such as different language versions or some test versions.
 

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in
the diagram the way we do?

What are the pros and cons of Git's automatic merging vs. always doing merges
manually?
