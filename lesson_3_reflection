When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When I am working on a project with other people and need to share files.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because otherwise the changes from GitHub might conflict with what I am working on, so I need to make sure that I really want to pull that change from GitHub.


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?


Fork is a copy of repository especially made within GitHub.
Clone is a copy of repository. It can be between computers or within a computer.
Branch is a history of commit that separated from the main history chain.
When I would like to try another features or versions of what I am making, I would make branches.
When I want a copy of a repository from somewhere to my own environment, I would make clones.
When I want a copy of a repository within GitHub and make some changes without affecting the original, I would make forks.


What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

I can make sure of the latest(up-to-date) version on GitHub, without updating my local files.
I can compare my local changes and someone else's changes on GitHub by using git log and git diff.
