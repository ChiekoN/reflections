When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When I am working on a project with other people and need to share files.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because otherwise the changes from GitHub might conflict with what I am working on, so I need to make sure that I really want to pull that change from GitHub.
